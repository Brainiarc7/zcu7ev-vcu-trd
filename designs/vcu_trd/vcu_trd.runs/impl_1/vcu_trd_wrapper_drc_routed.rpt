2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
3 out of 9 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: reset_rtl_0, mdio_rtl_0_mdc, mdio_rtl_0_mdio_io.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
5 out of 9 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: reset_rtl_0, diff_clock_rtl_0_clk_n, diff_clock_rtl_0_clk_p, mdio_rtl_0_mdc, mdio_rtl_0_mdio_io.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer mdio_rtl_0_mdio_iobuf/IBUFCTRL_INST (in mdio_rtl_0_mdio_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vcu_trd_i/v_smpte_uhdsdi_tx_ss_0/inst/v_tc/U0/U_VIDEO_CTRL/GEN_HAS_IRQ.irq_i_1_n_0_bufg_place is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vcu_trd_i/v_smpte_uhdsdi_tx_ss_0/inst/v_tc/U0/U_VIDEO_CTRL/GEN_HAS_IRQ.irq_i_1/O, cell vcu_trd_i/v_smpte_uhdsdi_tx_ss_0/inst/v_tc/U0/U_VIDEO_CTRL/GEN_HAS_IRQ.irq_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vcu_trd_i/vcu_clk_wiz0/inst/AXI_LITE_IPIF_I/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/current_state_reg[1]_bufg_place is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vcu_trd_i/vcu_clk_wiz0/inst/AXI_LITE_IPIF_I/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/current_state[3]_i_1/O, cell vcu_trd_i/vcu_clk_wiz0/inst/AXI_LITE_IPIF_I/I_SLAVE_ATTACHMENT/current_state[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
2 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are vcu_trd_i/v_smpte_uhdsdi_rx_ss_0/inst/v_smpte_uhdsdi_rx/inst/vid_in_axi4s_axis_rstn, vcu_trd_i/v_smpte_uhdsdi_rx_ss_0/inst/v_smpte_uhdsdi_rx/inst/vid_in_axi4s_mod_en_axi_r.
