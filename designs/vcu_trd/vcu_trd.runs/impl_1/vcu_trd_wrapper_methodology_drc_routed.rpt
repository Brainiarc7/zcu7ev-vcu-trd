CLKC-40#1 Advisory
Substitute PLLE4 for MMCME4 check  
The MMCME4 cell vcu_trd_i/clk_wiz/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has a single input clock whose source driver, UNKNOWN, is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
